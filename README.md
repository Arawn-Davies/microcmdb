# microcmdb
Small CMDB-style config manager for home network

Project Management Report and Work Progress
An up-to-date source code repository can be found on GitHub, on my personal account at https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/microcmdb. As is the case for a lot of the software development projects, Iâ€™ve created or contributed to over the years, they can be found at https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/. I will likely continue working on the project after the final deliverable is submitted as it is very applicable in an advanced home network with many client devices and assets with varying device classes such as mine.
